# Software

## Get Started

### mamba or micromamba
Basically, you need to create a Conda environment. Based on the documentation here: [https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html),
we suggest you to install a very fresh and basic environment by installing mamba from Mmabaforge distribution: [https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh).

After install mamba successfully, you can install many software into basic environment or create new environment to install software.
Of course, you also can activate other exists environment using `mamba activate /full path of exists env`. For example, ```mamba activate /home/jiezhu/.conda/envs/biobakery4```.

Below are some environment which contains some commonly used bioinformatics software.

| environment name  | full path  | software   |
|:-|:-|:-|
| biobakery4  | /home/jiezhu/.conda/envs/biobakery4  | metaphlan4 v4.0.6  |
